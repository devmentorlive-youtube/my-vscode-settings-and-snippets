# VS Code and Emmet Snippets and Settings
*Mark Tellez*

## Please consider supporting my work!

If you use my code, watch my videos, or learn from my livestreams, please remember that I am giving my time to allow those who have no money but want to learn, access to high quality learning materials that cost a lot of money on other platforms.

If you can give me a buck or two, it would mean the WORLD to me, and to you it's just a buck or two. (or 500 üòÅ) You will be paying it forward to all the people who can't afford anything right now in these trying time.

## What is this?

These are my own snippets and settings for modern web development using VS Code.

I don't like installing extensions into VS Code unless they are absolutely required because I want things runninng _fast_. Why download thousands of shortcuts and snippets that are out of date and that I don't use when I can write custom snippets that fit my workflow perfectly, *and* sharpen my coding skills while I am at it!

## How to use?

To use, just copy/point your settings (json view) to these files

- settings.json (VS Code)
- snippets.json (Emmet)
